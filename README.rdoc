== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
    Ruby: 2.2.0 
    Rails: 4.2.4

* Database
    Mongodb

This is one of the simple application. Using this you can shorten your url, like tinyurl.
For this application I have used Mongo DB for keeping the data.
